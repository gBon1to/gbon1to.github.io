My name is **Gustavo Bonito** (alias **B0N1T0**), I'm from Portugal and I'm full-time Pentester, Bug Hunter, [Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/058f7d67-06a4-4496-a30f-afc154db954c/public_url) and [Offensive Security Web Expert (OSWE)](https://www.credly.com/badges/7873ef7b-c25b-4075-9d67-9df8ef27e1ad/public_url).
